      <h2>Quest IRL</h2>
      <p>
        My first idea that I've brought to fruition completely solo, Quest IRL
        makes self-development a little more enjoyable by incorporating an RPG
        style theme to life. It allows you to track your progress as you grow
        and become a better person than you were yesterday. I believe this is
        important because growth is necessary to live a fulfilling life.

        <!-- If you're ever
        feeling stagnant in life you can open Quest IRL to work towards
        something small everyday, because always remember if you're not growing
        you're dying. -->
